class SomeClass:
    def create_arr(self): # An instance method
        self.arr = []
    
    def insert_to_arr(self, value):  #An instance method
        self.arr.append(value)
        
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):
        print("the class method was called")
        
self points to an instance(object) method
cls points to a class method

There can be static methods that do no point to self
Example: class A(object):

    @staticmethod
    def stat_meth():
        print("Look no self was passed")
Here, @staticmethod is a function decorator which makes stat_meth() static. Let us instantiate this 
class and call the method.


>>> a = A()
>>> a.stat_meth()
Look no self was passed
